XML_Feed_Parser 1.0.3 is not currently actively maintained, and has
a nasty bug which breaks getting the feed target link from WordPress
feeds and possibly others that are RSS2-formatted but include an
<atom:link> self-link element as well.

Patch from this bug report is included:
http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=16416

If upgrading, be sure that fix is included with the future upgrade!
