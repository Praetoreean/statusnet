Localizations for StatusNet are being maintained through TranslateWiki:
http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:StatusNet

Note if you are working with a direct git checkout, you will need to build
the binary .mo files from the .po source files for translations to work
in the web app.

If gettext and GNU make are installed, you can simply run 'make' in this
directory to build them.
